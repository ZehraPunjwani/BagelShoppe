-- 4. Receipt - Create an itemized receipt for the customer order that generated a discount. To help you write the query, you can hard code the order number. 
--Write a SELECT statement that lists Bagels first, BagelFillings, and finally Drinks as a single query result. For each item show at least the Description, 
--Price, and Quantity purchased. (Hint: You may want to use string CONCAT to add the Drink Size to the Drink Description for a prettier receipt).
